# Tubeculosis-Object-Detection

The main goal of the project is to streamlline object detection of tuberculosis bacteria from microscopic sputum samples, which when done manually is labour intensive and prone to human error. The project will explore two avenues where it will be exploring various other two-stage and single-stage object detection models to figure out the superior model for such tasks and will also be exploring to integrate exlainable AI in the same.

Edit-1: The jupyter notebook for final YOLO-v8 implpementation has been updated in the repo with slightly tweaked hyperparameters. This also utilised various data pre-processing techniques like auto-align and horizontal-vertical flip to increase the model performance by ensuring more training data.
